# SumITComp.API
WV SumITComp Online 
“SumITComp Online” wants to develop a website that can sell computer parts online. They want to start with developing an API layer that can provide required resources to support their front-end website. As they are agile team they want to release their API in iterations. In their first iteration they want resources to create and maintain their product catalogue.
Your job is to develop a solution for them to store the product details into some data store (SQL server, NoSQL or flat file) and access those using REST resources. Minimum data for products they want to collect is ProductId, Title, Description and Price as minimum data. You have to develop API resources to:
1.	list all products
2.	add a new product
3.	update existing product
4.	remove a product
